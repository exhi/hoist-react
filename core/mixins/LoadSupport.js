 * Mixin to indicate that a component has a model that implements data loading.
 *
 * This mixin will cause the loadAsync() method to be called on any owned model when this component is
 * first mounted.  This mixin will also cause the component's model to be registered/unregistered with
 * the appropriate RefreshContextModel when the component is mounted/unmounted.
 *
 * Implementation Note:
 * The use of this mixin is required for technical reasons, due to limitations of the pre-hooks
 * context API.   Expect this behavior to be built in to all HoistComponents in future versions of hoist.
