 * Mixin to indicate that a Component's primary backing model implements data loading.
 *
 * This mixin will register the component's primary model with the appropriate RefreshContextModel
 * and call the model's loadAsync() method when the component is first mounted. It will also
 * unregister the model from the same RefreshContextModel when the component is unmounted.
 *
 * Implementation Note:
 * The use of this mixin is required for technical reasons, due to limitations of the pre-hooks
 * context API. Expect this to be built in to all HoistComponents in future versions of Hoist.
