         * track function, regardless of whether they - or any other observables - are accessed in
         * the run function. The reaction will also run only when the output of the track function

         * Specify the property 'track' to run the reaction continuously until disposal.  Alternatively, specify
         * the 'when' property to run this reaction only until the predicate passes, and the run function is executed
         * once.  (These map on to mobX's native `reaction()` and `when()` functions, respectively).

         *      underlying reaction() call. Specify this or `when`.
