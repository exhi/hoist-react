             * execution of the function. This provides convenient and often very efficient dynamic

             * In some cases, however, it is desirable or more clear to explicitly declare which
             * observables should be tracked and trigger a reaction, regardless of their use within
             * the function itself. See addReaction() below for that functionality.

             * @param {(number|Object)} [conf.debounce] - Specify to debounce run function with lodash.
             *      When specified as Object, should contain an 'interval' and other optional keys for

             * A reaction's run function will be executed on changes to any/all observables read in its
             * track function, regardless of whether they - or any other observables - are accessed in
             * the run function. The reaction will also run only when the output of the track function
             * changes, and this output is passed to the run function.
             *
             * Specify the property 'track' to run the reaction continuously until disposal.
             * Alternatively, specify the 'when' property to run this reaction only until the predicate
             * passes, and the run function is executed once. (These map to mobX's native `reaction()`
             * and `when()` functions, respectively).
             *
             * Choose this method over an autorun when you wish to explicitly declare which observables
             * should be tracked. A common pattern is to have the track function return these
             * observables in a simple array or object, which the run function can use as its input or
             * (commonly) ignore. This helps to clarify that the track function is only enumerating
             * the observables to be watched, and not necessarily generating or transforming values.

             *      underlying when() call. Specify this or `track`.
