/**
 * Specialized base class for defining a Hoist Application. An instance of this class will be
 * initialized by Hoist after the framework has successfully initialized and will remain available
 * to all code via the XH.appModel getter.
 *
 * Applications should specify this class to provide application level state and services and
 * customize important metadata. Initialization of all resources (e.g. application level services)
 * should be done in initAsync().
 *
 * Hoist will load/reload this Model during the global refresh process.  This will occur before the
 * application's global XH.refreshContextModel has been refreshed, (when all mounted and 'owned'
 * HoistModels in the application are refreshed). Apps should implement a doloadAsync() to refresh all
 * other app-specific services and models, respecting any ordering and phasing requirements that
 * may exist.  {@see HoistBase.doLoadAsync()}
