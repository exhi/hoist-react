/**
 * Model to manage refreshing sections of the application, where "refreshing" refers to app-specific
 * actions to load and display updated data. Calling `refreshAsync()` on this model will cause it to
 * trigger a refresh on all linked models within its containing context.
 *
 * A global instance of this class is provided by the framework as `XH.refreshModel`. Apps can
 * create additional RefreshModels and pass them to nested RefreshView components to establish
 * distinct areas of the component hierarchy that can then be refreshed independently.
 *
 * Note that TabContainer automatically establishes separate RefreshModels for its tabs and uses
 * these to implement efficient refresh handling of inactive / not-yet-rendered tabs. See the
 * `refreshMode` configs on `TabContainerModel` and `TabModel` for more information on this common
 * use case.
