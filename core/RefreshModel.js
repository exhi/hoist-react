/**
 * Refresh Model.
 *
 * This object controls the refreshing of sections of the application.
 *
 * A global instance of this class is provided by the framework as
 * XH.refreshModel.  Applications may create additional sub-models to apply
 * to individual sections of the graphical hierarchy by the use of nested
 * RefreshViews.
 *
 * Also note that TabContainer establishes seperate RefreshModels for its
 * tabs and uses these to implement efficient refresh handling within its hidden
 * tabs.  See TabContainerModel.refreshMode and TabModel.refreshMode for more
 * information.
