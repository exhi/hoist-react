             * Model instance which this component is rendering.
             *
             * Applications specify a Component's model by either setting it as a field directly on the
             * Component class definition or by passing it as a prop from a parent Component. If
             * provided as a prop, the model can be passed as either an already-created class instance
             * or as a config for one to be created internally. A Component class definition should
             * include a static `modelClass` field to support this latter create-on-demand pattern.
             *
             * Parent components should provide concrete instances of models to their children only if
             * they wish to programmatically access those models to reference data or otherwise
             * manipulate the component using the model's API. Otherwise, models can and should be
             * created internally by the Component, either in the class definition or via a config
             * object prop.
             *
             * Models that are created internally by the component may be considered "owned" models.
             * They will be destroyed when the component is unmounted (via destroy()).
             *
             * When concrete instances are provided via props they are assumed to be owned and managed
             * by a parent Component. Otherwise models are considered to be "locally owned" by the
             * Component itself and will be destroyed when the Component is unmounted and destroyed.
             *
             * The model instance is not expected to change for the lifetime of the component. Apps that
             * wish to swap out the model for a mounted component should ensure that a new instance of
             * the component gets mounted. This can be accomplished by setting the component's `key`
             * prop to `model.xhId` (as a model will always return an ID unique to each instance).
             *
             * @see HoistModel
