         * or as a prop specifed by a parent Component.   If specified as a prop, it can be specified as either an actual
         * model instance, or a config for one to be created of type 'modelClass'.
         *
         * Parent components should provide concrete instances of models to their children only if they wish to
         * programmatically access those models to reference data, or manipulate the component.  Otherwise the models
         * should be created 'locally' either in the class definition, or via the config object.  When created
         * 'locally', models are assumed to be owned by this component and will also be destroyed when the
         * component itself is unmounted and destroyed.
         *
         * The model object is not expected to change for the lifetime of the component.  Applications that wish to
         * change the model for a mounted component should ensure that a new instance of the component gets mounted --
         * this can be done easily by setting the component's key prop to model.xhId().
