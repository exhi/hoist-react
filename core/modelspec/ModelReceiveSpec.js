 * @param {(Class|string|function)} selector - Specification of HoistModel to receive.  Should be a HoistModel 'selector'
 *      (classname, string, or function). '*' indicates any, or the most closely
 *      inherited model in context. See HoistModel.matches() for more info.
 * @param {Object} [flags]
 * @param {boolean} [flags.provide] - also place model in context so that contained components may consume.
 *      Default true.
 * @param {boolean} [flags.optional] - True if model should be optional.  Default false.
 * @param {boolean} [flags.fromContext] - look for model in context.  Default true
 * @param {boolean} [flags.fromConfig] - true to accept model from config, and generate a model instance
 *      locally.  Note that any model created in this  way will be considered to be 'owned' by the receiving
 *      component, and will be loaded and destroyed as if it were local.  Selector must be a classname of a
 *      HoistModel. Default to true.
