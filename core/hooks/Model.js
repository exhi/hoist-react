/**
 * This hook provides support for components that will receive a model from props.
 * The model can be passed as either an already-created class instance or as a config
 * for one to be created internally.
 *
 * Parent components should provide concrete instances of models to their children only if
 * they wish to programmatically access those models to reference data or otherwise
 * manipulate the component using the model's API. Otherwise, models can be created
 * via a config object.  Models that are created internally by the component may be
 * considered "owned" models.  They will be destroyed when the component is unmounted
 * (via destroy()).
 *
 * The model instance is not expected to change for the lifetime of the component. Apps that
 * wish to swap out the model for a mounted component should ensure that a new instance of
 * the component gets mounted. This can be accomplished by setting the component's `key`
 * prop to `model.xhId` (as a model will always return an ID unique to each instance).
 *
 * @param {Object} modelClass - class defining a HoistModel
 * @param {Array} props
 * @returns {Object} - instance of a HoistModel
