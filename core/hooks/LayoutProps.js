/**
 * This hook provides support for flexbox related styles that are set as top-level properties
 * on a component.
 *
 * The following properties will be supported:
 *     margin, marginTop, marginRight, marginBottom, marginLeft,
 *     padding, paddingTop, paddingRight, paddingBottom, paddingLeft,
 *     height, minHeight, maxHeight, width, minWidth, maxWidth,
 *     flex, flexBasis, flexDirection, flexGrow, flexShrink, flexWrap,
 *     alignItems, alignSelf, alignContent, justifyContent,
 *     overflow, overflowX, overflowY,
 *     top, left, position, display
 *
 * Use of this hook indicates that the Component will respect and respond to these properties.
 * Components will typically delegate this responsibility to a child component that also
 * implements LayoutSupport. `Box` is typically the Component that is ultimately rendered
 * and will handle this by outputting a div with appropriate styles.
