/**
 * Hook to allow a component to access a HoistModel provided by an ancestor component, or props.  A model
 * set directly on props will take precedence.
 *
 * The model instance is not expected to change for the lifetime of the component. Apps that wish
 * to swap out the model for a mounted component should ensure that a new instance of the component
 * gets mounted. This can be done by rendering the component with a `key` prop set to `model.xhId`, as
 * HoistModels always return IDs unique to each instance.
 *
 * @param {(Class|string)} [selector] - class or name of mixin applied to class of
 *      model to be returned.  If not provided the 'closest' inherited model will be returned.
 * @param {Array} [props] - provide to do initial search in props.
 *
 * @returns model or null if no matching model found.
