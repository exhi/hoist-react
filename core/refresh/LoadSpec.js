/**
 * Metadata describing Load/Refresh request in Hoist.
 *
 * This object is create by LoadSupport, and passed to implementations of doLoadAsync().
 *
 * Application implementations of doLoadAsync() should consult this object's flags. Of particular
 * interest are the 'isLatest' and the 'isObsolete properties', which implementations can use to
 * determine if they should abandon any in-progress state modifications.  'isLatest' will be false
 * if there is a pending load which is newer than this load.  'isObsolete' will return true if
 * there is a newer load has successfully completed.
 *
 * In addition, implementations of doLoadAsync() should typically pass along this object to
 * any delegating calls to loadAsync() on other objects, as well as all calls to FetchServices.
