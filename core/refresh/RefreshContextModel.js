/**
 * A model that can manage refreshing sections of the application, where "refreshing" refers to
 * app-specific actions to load and display updated data. Calling `refreshAsync()` on this model
 * will cause it to trigger a refresh on all linked models within the graphical hierarchy it contains.
 *
 * A global instance of this interface is provided by the framework as `XH.refreshContextModel`. Apps
 * can create additional sub-contexts using a RefreshContextView paired with this object.
 *
 * Note that TabContainer automatically establishes separate refresh contexts for its tabs and uses
 * these to implement efficient refresh handling of inactive and not-yet-rendered tabs. See the
 * `refreshMode` configs on `TabContainerModel` and `TabModel` for more information on this common
 * use case.
