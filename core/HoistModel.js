/**
 * Base class for State Models in Hoist.
 *
 * Adds support for mobx reactivity, resource management, persistence, and data loading
 *
 * A common use of HoistModel is to serve as a backing store for a HoistComponent.  Furthermore, if
 * a model is *created* by a HoistComponent it is considered to be 'owned' (or "hosted") by that
 * component.  An owned model will be automatically destroyed when its component is unmounted.
 *
 * HoistModels that need to load/refresh may implement doLoadAsync().  See @LoadSupport for more
 * information.  If specified, this method will be used to load data into the model when its
 * component is first mounted.  It will also register the model with the nearest
 * RefreshContextModel for subsequent refreshes.
