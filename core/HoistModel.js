/**
 * Core decorator for State Models in Hoist.
 *
 * All State models in Hoist applications should typically be decorated with this function.
 * Adds support for managed events and mobx reactivity.
 *
 * A common use of HoistModel is to serve as a backing store for a HoistComponent.  Furthermore, if
 * a model is *created* by a HoistComponent it is considered to be 'owned' (or "hosted") by that
 * component.  An owned model will be automatically destroyed when its component is unmounted.
 *
 * For HoistModels that need to load/refresh data consider implementing LoadSupport.
 * This decorator will load data into the model when its component is first mounted, and will
 * register the model with the nearest RefreshContextModel for subsequent refreshes.
 *
 * @see LoadSupport
