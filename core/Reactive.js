     * Add and start a managed reaction.
     *
     * A reaction's run function will be executed on changes to any/all observables read in its
     * track function, regardless of whether they - or any other observables - are accessed in
     * the run function. The reaction will also run only when the output of the track function
     * changes, and this output is passed to the run function.
     *
     * Specify the property 'track' to run the reaction continuously until disposal.
     * Alternatively, specify the 'when' property to run this reaction only until the predicate
     * passes, and the run function is executed once. (These map to mobX's native `reaction()`
     * and `when()` functions, respectively).
     *
     * Choose this method over an autorun when you wish to explicitly declare which observables
     * should be tracked. A common pattern is to have the track function return these
     * observables in a simple array or object, which the run function can use as its input or
     * (commonly) ignore. This helps to clarify that the track function is only enumerating
     * the observables to be watched, and not necessarily generating or transforming values.
     *
     *  This reaction will be disposed of automatically when this object is destroyed. It can also be
     *  ended/disposed of manually using the native mobx disposer function returned by this method.
     *
     * @param {Object} conf - configuration of reaction, containing options accepted by MobX
     *      reaction() API, as well as arguments below.
     * @param {function} [conf.track] - function returning data to observe - first arg to the
     *      underlying reaction() call. Specify this or `when`.
     * @param {function} [conf.when] - function returning data to observe - first arg to the
     *      underlying when() call. Specify this or `track`.
     * @param {function} conf.run - function to run - second arg to underlying reaction()/when() call.
     * @param {(number|Object)} [conf.debounce] - Specify to debounce run function with lodash.
     *      When specified as object, should contain an 'interval' and other optional keys for
     *      lodash.  If specified as number the default lodash debounce will be used.
     * @returns {function} - disposer to manually dispose of the created reaction.
