/**
 * A text input Component that generates a filter function based on simple word-boundary matching of
 * its value to the value of configured fields on a candidate object. If any field values match, the
 * object itself is considered a match.
 *
 * Designed to easily filter records within a Store - either directly (most common) or indirectly
 * via a callback (in cases where custom logic is required, such as layering on additional filters).
 * A Store can be bound to this component via either its `store` OR `gridModel` props, or manually
 * by writing an onFilterChange prop.
 *
 * This object will default to point to the store of a GridModel found in context, if neither a store,
 * nor a GridModel are provided.  If you *do* not want this behavior (e.g. you intend to manually
 * wire it with onFilterChange) be sure to set GridModel to *null*.
 *
 * Fields to be searched can be automatically determined from the bound Store or GridModel, and/or
 * customized via the include/excludeFields props. See prop comments for details.
 *
 * This component supports all props available to TextInput and will pass them along to its
 * underlying TextInput.
