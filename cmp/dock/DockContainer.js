/**
 * DockContainer provides a user-friendly way to render multiple child components "docked" to its
 * bottom edge. Each view is rendered with a configurable header and controls to allow the user to
 * expand it, collapse it, or optionally "pop it out" into a modal dialog.
 *
 * This mirrors the behavior of the familiar Gmail "compose" window and is intended for similar
 * use-cases such as detail panels and forms, where the user might wish to open multiple children
 * in a non-modal and unobtrusive manner.
 *
 * Docked views are sized according to their content. It is recommended to provide the docked
 * content with a fixed size.
 *
 * DockContainerModel configures all aspects of this container, including its views. See that class
 * for more details.
 *
