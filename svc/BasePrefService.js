/**
 * Service to read and set user-specific preference values.
 *
 * Server-side preference support is provided by hoist-core. Preferences must be predefined on the
 * server (they can be managed via the Admin console) and are referenced by their string key. They
 * are assigned default values that apply to users who have yet to have a value set that is specific
 * to their account. Once set, however, the user will get their customized value instead of the
 * default going forwards.
 *
 * This could happen via an explicit option the user adjusts, or happen transparently based on a
 * natural user action or component integration (e.g. collapsing or resizing a `Resizable` that has
 * been configured with preference support).
 *
 * Preferences are persisted automatically back to the server by default so as to follow their user
 * across workstations. A `local` flag can be set on the preference definition, however, to persist
 * user values to local storage instead. This should be used for prefs that are more natural to
 * associate with a particular machine or browser (e.g. sizing or layout related options).
