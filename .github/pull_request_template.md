Hoist P/R Checklist

**Pull request authors:** Review and check off the below. Items that do not apply can also be

**If your change is still a WIP**, please use the "Create draft pull request" option in the split
button below to indicate it is not ready yet for a final review.

> **Pull request reviewers:** when merging this P/R, please consider using a *squash commit* to
> collapse multiple intermediate commits into a single commit representing the overall feature
> change. This helps keep the commit log clean and easy to scan across releases. PRs containing a
> single commit should be *rebased* when possible.
