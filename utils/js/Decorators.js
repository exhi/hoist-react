 * Log an error if a parameterized decorator is applied without being called first.
 *
 * Call this when defining a 'parameterized' decorator that needs to be called as a function.
 * This will throw if the decorator is ever applied to a property without calling it first -
 * an easy-to-make mistake given that many core decorators are *not* parameterized. See the
 * implementation of `field` decorator for an example.
 *
 *  @param {string} decoratorName - the name of the decorator being defined.
 *  @param {...*} params - the arguments passed to the invocation of the parameterized decorator.
