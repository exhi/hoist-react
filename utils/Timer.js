/**
 *
 * Promise-aware recurring task timer for use by framework and applications.
 *
 * This object is designed to be robust across failing tasks, and never to re-run the task
 * simultaneously, unless in the case of a timeout.  Callers can optionally specify
 * the duration of asynchronous tasks by returning a Promise from runFn.
 *
 * This object seeks to mirror the API and semantics of the server-side equivalent 'Timer'
 * as closely as possible. However there are important  differences due to the synchronous
 * nature of javascript.  In particular, there is no support for 'runImmediatelyAndBlock'
 * and the 'timeout' argument will not be able to interrupt synchronous activity of the runFn.
