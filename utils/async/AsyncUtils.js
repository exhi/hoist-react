/**
 * Iterate over a collection and run a closure on each item - as with `for ... of` - but do so
 * asynchronously and with minimal waits inserted after a configurable time interval.
 *
 * Intended for long-running or compute-intensive loops that would otherwise lock up the browser
 * if run synchronously. Waiting at regular intervals minimizes blocking of user interactions,
 * allowing ongoing rendering of UI updates (e.g. load masks) and generally keeping the browser
 * event loop running.
 *
 * NOTE this is NOT for use cases where the `fn` arg is itself async - i.e. it does not await the
 * call to `fn` and is instead for the opposite use case, where fn is *synchronous*. If looking to
 * run an async operation over a collection, consider a for...of loop as per implementation below.
 *
 * @param {Iterable} collection - items to iterate over
 * @param {Function} fn - called with each item.
 * @param {Object} [opts] - additional options.
 * @param {number} [opts.waitAfter] - interval in ms after which the loop should pause and wait.
 *      If the loop completes before this interval has passed, no waits will be inserted.
 * @param {number} [opts.waitFor] - wait time in ms for each pause. The default of 1ms should be
 *      sufficient to allow an event loop cycle to run.
 * @param {string?} [opts.debug] - if provided, loop will debug log basic run info on completion.
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
