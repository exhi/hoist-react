/**
 * Wrapper object for each data element within a {@see Store}. Records must be assigned a unique ID
 * within their Store and manage a bundle of data with fields defined by the Store. They track the
 * state of that data through possible updates, with support for tracking edits and "committing"
 * changes to provide dirty state.
 *
 * Records also store state related to any parent/child hierarchy, if present.
 *
 * Records are intended to be created and managed internally by Store implementations and should
 * most not typically be constructed directly within application code.
