     *          Executed when the user clicks the menuitem.
     *          It is passed the menuitem, clicked grid record, and current grid selection.
     *
     * @param enableFn, optional, function(item, record, selection).
     *
     *          The enableFn is a callback that is triggered before each time the menuitem is shown.
     *          It should return a boolean for whether or not to enable the menuitem.
     *
     * @param hideFn, optional, function(item, record, selection).
     *
     *          The hideFn is a callback that is triggered before each time the menuitem is shown.
     *          It should return a boolean for whether or not to hide the menuitem.

     * @param prepareFn, optional, function(item, record, selection).
     *
     *          The prepareFn is a callback that is triggered before each time the menuitem is shown.
     *          It can be used to modify the menuitem based on the record / selection.
     *
     * @param recordsRequired how many records must be 'active' (selected and / or clicked upon) for the menuitem to be enabled.
     *
     *          int: specifies exactly n number of records. Defaults to 1 for single record actions.
     *               Can specify 0 to only enable menuitem if no records are active.
     *          true: specifies that number of records > 0. Allows for arbitrary number of records.
     *          false:  specifies any number of records (0 - infinity, inclusive). Always active.
