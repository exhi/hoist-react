/**
 * Display a set of views in a dock. Using a DockContainer provides a user-friendly way to display multiple
 * views simultaneously, allowing users to choose of which views are expanded at any given time. Docked views
 * can be either expanded or collapsed. They also support being taken out of the dock and displayed as a dialog.
 *
 * Docked views are sized according to their content. It is recommended to provide the docked
 * content with a fixed size.
 *
 * This component's DockContainerModel configures all aspects of this container, including its views.
 * See that class for more details.
